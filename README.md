### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Andrei


Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on as ML Engineer
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Adversarial ML, GANs, MLOps
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Adversarial ML
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me how to break your ML model to classify images correctly
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: LinkedIn is fine
- âš¡ Fun fact: I wrote my first program at 12 on USSR programming calculator [MK-61](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elektronika_MK-61). It was a number guesser.
